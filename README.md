# Simply-Notes
##### A simple yet intuitive note app for the web.

### The App
Using web based technologies to build a simple yet intuitive note app that aims to serve a single purpose and do it well. It will feature being able to add a note, scroll a list of notes or search for a note by title/body. The note view will be an active form with auto saving to keep note taking easy and fast for creating, reading, updating, and deleting.

### The Goal
Really wanted to gain experience building with the tech stack:
###### Back End
  - Python
  - Flask
  - SQLite
  - Django
###### Front End
  - JavaScript
  - React
  - Axios
  - React Context Selector
  - Material UI
  - React Router Dom
  - Formik

### The Future
This would be a good opportunity to add several features to make this a well rounded and easy to use app. Some future features that this app would benefit from including are:
- Integrating with ChatGPT for added benefit of easy querying with Ai.
- Configuring a Local Storage solution in order to have an offline mode.
- Setting it up as a PWA (Progressive Web App) to get some added feature and benefit of treating this like a native app.
